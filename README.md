- Hi, Iâ€™m @BigEarniEarn. I have dabbled in software development for the past 8 years (without any particular structure) while operating and running our family business.
- Since then, I have grown into a techy and have embarked on a software engineering course with ALX.
- I am doing this to be able to;
- 1.) have a fully-fledged understanding of SWE with all its intricacies and dependancies, and
- 2.) to convert my mental richness of ideas, ecosystems & understandings into actionable algorithms and create a better next day.
- Reach me at bongilekb@gmail.com, I look forward to working with you gorgeous-minded people!
